=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Deprecated - add metadata to your distribution marking it as deprecated

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [Deprecated]

or

    [Deprecated]
    module = MyApp::OlderAPI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that adds metadata to your distribution marking it as deprecated.

This uses the unofficial C<x_deprecated> field,
which is a new convention for marking a CPAN distribution as deprecated.
You should still note that the distribution is deprecated in the documentation,
for example in the abstract and the first paragraph of the DESCRIPTION section.

You can also mark a single module (or subset of modules) as deprecated by
listing them with the C<module> option.  This will add an C<x_deprecated>
field to the C<provides> section of metadata.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

=head2 C<module>

Identify a specific module to be deprecated. Can be used more than once.

=head2 C<all>

Not normally needed directly. Mark an entire distribution as deprecated. This
defaults to true when there are no C<module>s listed, and false otherwise.
